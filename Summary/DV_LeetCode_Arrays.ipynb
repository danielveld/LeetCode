    "# Arrays\n",
    "***\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "An array is a data structure that allows you to store multiple values of the same type sequentially. It provides an index to organize and access related data elements. The index represents the position of an element within the array, starting from 0. Arrays are commonly used to store and manipulate collections of data efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Static and Dynamic\n",
    "There are two types of arrays. You do not have to specify the size in a **dynamic array**. In a **static array**, you do specify the size. The **static array** can be quicker if you know how much you must allocate, but the downfall is that if you exceed this limit, you must add another array or relocate memory. Since Python is my go-to language for learning algorithms, I use Python **lists** which are the equivalent of the **dynamic array**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advantages\n",
    "> - store multiple elements of the same type with one single variable name\n",
    "> - store elements in a contiguous block of memory, which makes it easy to iterate over the elements sequentially\n",
    "> - allow for direct and efficient access to elements using their index\n",
    "\n",
    "## Disadvantages\n",
    "> - inserting or deleting elements within can be inefficient since elements need to be shifted to maintain a sequential order except for the first and last element\n",
    "> - if more elements need to be stored than the initial size allows in a fixed array, the entire array may need to be recreated with a larger size resulting in time and space ineficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Terms\n",
    "### Subarray\n",
    "A **subbarray** is a range of sequential elements within an array. \n",
    "> **Array:** [0, 1, 2, 3]<br>\n",
    "> **Subbarray:** [0, 1]<br>\n",
    "> **Not a subbarray:** [0, 2, 3]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Subsequence\n",
    "A subsequence is a sequence of elements that can be obtained by removing elements from the original sequence while preserving the relative order of the remaining elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Array:** [0, 3, 5, 2, 7, 8]<br>\n",
    "> **Subsequence:** [0, 5, 7, 8]<br>\n",
    "> **Not a subsequence:** [0, 7, 2, 8]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Time Complexity\n",
    "| Operation | Big-O | Note |\n",
    "| :-: | :-: | :-: |\n",
    "| Access | O(1)\t\n",
    "| Search | O(n)\t\n",
    "| Search (sorted array) | O(log(n))\t\n",
    "| Insert | O(n) | requires shifting all subsequent elements to the right\n",
    "| Insert (first or last element) | O(1) | no other element has to be shifted\n",
    "| Remove | O(n) | requires shifting all subsequent elements to the left by one\n",
    "| Remove (first or last element) |\tO(1) | no other element has to be shifted\n",
    "\n",
    "## Techniques\n",
    "### Strings\n",
    "A string is a sequence of characters, just as an array works sequentially. Therefore, most string problems can be solved using array techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hashmap\n",
    "A **hashmap**, or a **hash table**, is a data structure that provides efficient storage and retrieval of key-value pairs. It is based on the concept of hashing, which involves mapping keys to specific locations in an underlying **bucket array**.\n",
    "\n",
    "> - **Hashing function:** A hashing function is applied to the key when a key-value pair is inserted into a hashmap. This function calculates a unique hash code based on the key's value. This hash code determines the position (index) in the bucket array where the key-value pair will be stored.\n",
    "> - **Bucket array**: The bucket array is a collection of slots or buckets, each capable of storing one or more key-value pairs. The size of the bucket array is typically more extensive than the expected number of key-value pairs to reduce the chance of collisions (multiple keys mapping to the same index).\n",
    "> - **Indexing and storage:** The hash code produced by the hashing function is used as an index to locate the appropriate bucket in the bucket array. The key-value pair is then stored in that bucket. If multiple key-value pairs hash the same index, they can be stored in the same bucket using additional data structures like linked lists or binary trees.\n",
    "> - **Retrieval:** When a value associated with a given key needs to be retrieved, the hashing function is applied to the key again to calculate the hash code. This hash code is used to locate the corresponding bucket in the bucket array. If multiple key-value pairs exist in the bucket, the hashmap uses the key comparison to find the exact pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages\n",
    "> - hashmaps provide constant-time (O(1)) average-case lookup and retrieval operations, making them efficient for large datasets\n",
    "> - hashmaps can store any type of data as both keys and values\n",
    "> - hashmaps can dynamically resize themselves to accommodate more elements as needed\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Disadvantages\n",
    "> - different keys can produce the same hash code resulting in hash collisions. Collision resolution techniques, such as chaining or open addressing, are used to handle such cases\n",
    "> - hashmaps do not maintain any particular order for the key-value pairs\n",
    "\n",

    "### Sliding Window\n",
    "A **sliding window** is a subset of elements in a larger sequence or array. It involves maintaining a window or a fixed-size subarray that \"slides\" through the larger array, typically one element at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "> - **Define the window size:** Determine the size or length of the window/subarray that will be used for processing. This size can vary depending on the specific problem or requirements.\n",
    "> - **Initialize the window:** Set up the initial window by selecting the first set of elements from the larger array, starting from the beginning.\n",
    "> - **Process the window:** Perform the desired operations or computations on the elements within the window. This could involve calculations, aggregations, comparisons, or other relevant operations based on the problem.\n",
    "> - **Slide the window:** Move the window by shifting it from one position to the right (or left) within the larger array. This means removing the leftmost element from the window and adding the next element on the right.\n",
    "> - **Repeat steps 3 and 4:** Continue processing and sliding the window until the end of the larger array is reached. This allows for systematically analyzing or processing each subset of elements within the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Two Pointers**<br>\n",
    "The difference between a **sliding window** and **two pointers** is that the pointers of a **sliding window** are on the same array and never cross each other. **Two pointers** is a more general version where the pointers can cross each other and be on different arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages**\n",
    "> - avoids unnecessary reprocessing of elements, reducing the time complexity of the algorithm\n",
    "> - can often be implemented with a constant amount of extra space, making it memory efficient\n",
    "> - straightforward and simple to implement\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages**\n",
    "> - is applicable to a specific subset of problems that involve contiguous segments or subarrays. \n",
    "> - determining the optimal window size or defining the sliding conditions can be problem-dependent\n",
    "> - the sliding window technique may introduce additional complexity in order to optimize efficiency. \n",
