Since an anagram is always the same length and contains the same characters, we can sort both strings and compare. While this improves space, the big O of space heavily depends on which function or built-in function you use. So space's big O will be O(n) or O(1). I have not used this sorting method because the big O of time will increase to 0(nlogn).\n",
