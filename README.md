# LeetCode

This repository is meant to show how I solved LeetCode problems and learned from them. The goal is to understand different algorithms and be efficient regarding time and space complexity. 

For my solutions, I use Python since it is an easy and quick language. This way, I can focus on the problems and algorithms instead of the programming language. The documentation is done with Jupyter Notebook, which enables the use of Markdown for writing explanations.

## Navigation

- [summary](Summary]: the summary folder is for explaining algorithms
- the Blind75 is a list of 75 essential LeetCode solutions
- in the AllProblems folder I store all LeetCode solutions
## Roadmap

These are the goals I'm currently working towards:

- solving and documenting the Blind75 problem list
- writing summaries for the algorithms used in problem sets


## Acknowledgements

These are the sources I used to solve and understand LeetCode problems. I couldn't have written the step-by-step solution process without them:
