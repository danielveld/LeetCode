    "\n",
    "To understand the problem correctly, I conceptualize how brute force works in this case. We begin by iterating through the array and adding all other elements to the current iteration to find the target. If, for example, array 'nums' is [2,7,11,15], we add all numbers one by one to 2 (index 0) to find the target. Then we will move on to 7 and repeat the same process of adding all numbers one by one to find the target and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "By understanding this concept, we can improve upon it by iterating through the array and finding a way to know the second number to get the target value without adding all other numbers one by one to the current iteration.<br>\n",

    "Space:<b>O(1)</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Solution 2</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "To improve on time complexity, we will create an empty hashmap. Next, we loop through array 'nums' and keep track of the number of iterations with the help of the function 'enumerate'. Then, we calculate the difference between the target and the current iteration for every iteration to determine the second number. If the calculated second number is in our hashmap, we return the number pair that adds to the target. If the second number is not in the hashmap, we add the first number to our hashmap with the index. Eventually, the program will calculate a second number already in our hashmap as the first number, and we found our solution!<br>\n",
